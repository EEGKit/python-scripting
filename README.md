# Bonsai - Python Scripting

Bonsai.Scripting.Python is a [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) interface for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. It uses [Python.NET](https://pythonnet.github.io/pythonnet/) under the hood to provide a seamless integration between the CPython runtime and data streaming in a Bonsai workflow.
